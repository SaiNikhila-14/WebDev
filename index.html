            <h2>Our Solar System</h2>
        <p>Our solar system is a vast and fascinating region 
            of space that consists of the Sun and everything bound to 
            it by gravity, including eight planets, their moons, dwarf
             planets, comets, asteroids, and countless particles of dust
              and gas. At the center lies the Sun, a massive ball of
               glowing plasma that provides the energy needed to sustain life on Earth. The planets, ranging from 
            the rocky inner worlds like Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars to the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn, and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune, orbit the Sun in nearly circular paths. Each celestial body in the solar system has unique characteristics, from the swirling storms on Jupiter to the icy rings of Saturn and the mysterious surface of Pluto. Together, they form a dynamic and ever-changing system tha
            t continues to inspire scientists and stargazers alike.</p>

            <h2>Planets</h2>
            <div id="planets-section">
            <div class="planets"><img src="mercury.jpeg" alt="Image of Mercury"><div class="layer"><h1>Mercury</h1>
            <p>Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun, known for its extreme temperatures and cratered surface.
                It has no atmosphere to trap heat, causing drastic changes between day and night temperatures.
                </p></div></div>
            <div class="planets"><img src="venus.jpeg" alt="Image of Venus"><div class="layer"><h1>Venus</h1>
            <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and the hottest, with a thick atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide and clouds of sulfuric acid.
                Its surface pressure is over 90 times that of Earth, making it a very hostile environment.</p></div></div>
            <div class="planets"><img src="earth.jpeg" alt="Image of Earth"><div class="layer"><h1>Earth</h1>
            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life, with water, oxygen, and a protective atmosphere.
                About 71% of Earth's surface is covered with water.</p></div></div>
            <div class="planets"><img src="mars.jpeg" alt="Image of Mars"><div class="layer"><h1>Mars</h1>
            <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, often called the "Red Planet" due to its iron-rich soil and dusty appearance.
                It has the largest volcano in the Solar System—Olympus Mons.</p></div></div>
            <div class="planets"><img src="jupiter.jpeg" alt="Image of Jupiter"><div class="layer"><h1>Jupiter</h1>
            <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet and the largest in the Solar System, famous for its massive storms and dozens of moons.
                Its Great Red Spot is a giant storm that has raged for centuries.</p></div></div>
            <div class="planets"><img src="saturn.jpg" alt="Image of Saturn"><div class="layer"><h1>Saturn</h1>
            <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun, best known for its stunning rings made of ice and rock particles.
                It has at least 145 moons, with Titan being the largest and most fascinating.</p></div></div>
            <div class="planets"><img src="uranus.jpeg" alt="Image of Uranus"><div class="layer"><h1>Uranus</h1>
            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, an ice giant that rotates on its side and appears blue due to methane in its atmosphere.
                It has a faint ring system and a cold, tilted magnetic field.</p></div></div>
            <div class="planets"><img src="neptune.jpeg" alt="Image of Neptune"><div class="layer"><h1>Neptune</h1>
            <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet in the Solar System, a windy and cold ice giant with a deep blue color.
                It has the strongest winds in the Solar System, reaching up to 1,200 mph (1,931 km/h).</p></div></div>
